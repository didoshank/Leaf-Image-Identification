# Leaf-Image-Identification
Identification of Leaf Images from a plant Image. We use two different models, one for segmentation and another for classification.

This paper uses two novel approaches, first one is to use Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to segment and extract a leaf image from a plant image. Secondly, we will be using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) with pre-trained model like Visual Geometry Group(VGG)) and MobileNetV2 for classification of the leaf image.
