# Leaf-Image-Identification
Identification of Leaf Images from a plant Image. We use two different models, one for segmentation and another for classification.

This paper uses two novel approaches, first one is to use Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) for leaf image segmentation from a plant image. Secondly, we will be using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) with pre-trained model like VGG and MobileNetV2, these models will be used exclusively for feature extraction and the classify the leaf images.
